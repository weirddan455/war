Work in progress prototype of a turn based strategy game using the Godot game engine (title subject to change)

## Licensing
The code is my own and is licensed under the MIT license.  Assets are *not* my own but are made available by their creators under free CC licences.  See assets/LICENSE for more information including attribution.

## To run
You will need to download/install the Godot game engine.  Once installed, you should be able to import the project into the editor.  I'm not releasing binaries at this early stage of development.
As of 4/24/2021, all code has been re-written in C#.  This means you no longer need to worry about compiling GDNative code but you will need a Mono build of Godot.
